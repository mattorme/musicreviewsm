### Development

- Planning started on Figma, where I did a quick mock-up of what the different pages would look like
  ![](img/music-planning.png)
- I then planned the database out on a notepad
- I started setting up the database and linking them to make the following user process easier
- Once the layout was setup, I could start programming actual features on my app
- As the progress of the server-side development became clearer, it pushed the progress of the client side further as they were tightly intertwined
- Towards the end, as the biggest features were complete, the process turned into little tasks to optimize the use of my app

### Unsolved Problems

- Not respsonsive
- No like button
- I spent too much time on bug fixes and didn't make the site look as good as I planned
- No follower count or like count
